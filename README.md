# 💼 Cristian.dev — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This is a modern, responsive, and animated personal website built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
It showcases my work, tech stack, and includes a working contact form, as well as a downloadable resume.
This project was built to present myself in a stylish, yet functional way to clients, recruiters, and collaborators.
It's a living project and will continue to evolve with new skills and projects.
